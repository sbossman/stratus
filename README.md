# Stratus

Stratus is a markup language I am creating that will be able to be converted
into HTML/CSS, once I am done. It was designed to be a slightly more appealing
way of doing web development/design for myself.

Once complete, this will be a static site generator that will convert Stratus
text into HTML, so I can port it to UF's computers for my website properly.

## To do
### Headers
- add in capabilities for importing non-CSS files

### Body
- capture tags
