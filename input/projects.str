    _h2(){ Stratus (Static Site Generator) }
    _p(){
        Stratus is a Static Site Generator I built for this website.
        It converts sites written in Stratus (a markdown language I
        created for my personal convenience and comfort) into HTML,
        so I can then load them onto the UF CISE web hosting (they
        only allow static HTML/CSS sites). I'm still perfecting it,
        but it is fully operational right now.

    _h2(){ Class Capture }
    _p(){
        Class Capture is a project I worked on with a few others in
        my class. It's a social media app that allows different users
        to join groups with their friends, coworkers, or classmates,
        and they can all upload photos. Then, at the end of a time
        period, all of the photos they took and uploaded will be
        released, so they can look back on the enjoyable times they
        had together. It is currently a work in progress.
    }
    _p(){
        It is a full stack web app that uses ReactJS for the front end
        and MongoDB for the back end. I did most of the work for the
        front end for this project, so I learned a lot of React for
        this project. I also did a fair amount of front end/back end
        connection fetching data from the database.

    _h2(){ Ao3 Trawler }
    _p(){
        In this project, I collaborated with my classmates in Data
        Structures and Algorithms to compare the efficiency of an
        adjacency matrix vs an adjacency list, when attempting to
        create the data structures and find paths between two points.
        We used data from the online fanfiction platform
        _a(href="https://archiveofourown.org/"){ Archive of Our Own}
        (Ao3), web scraping over 100,000 fanfictions, and their taglists.
        I wrote the code to turn the data points into the adjacency
        matrix and adjacency list, as well as the pathfinding algorithm
        for two points (we used a Breadth First Traversal to find the
        shortest route between two fanfictions).

    _h2(){ Line Distribution }
    _p(){
        This programming project is one I completed in high school. It
        parses through a TXT file of a Shakespeare play, and then
        identifies all of the different characters, as well as the number
        of lines they have, the words they speak, and the characters they
        talk to. Using this information, I also wrote an algorithm to
        distribute the different characters in the play to a different
        number of "readers," so no person reading the play out loud has
        to speak to themself.
