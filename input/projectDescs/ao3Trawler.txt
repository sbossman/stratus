In this project, I collaborated with my classmates in Data
Structures and Algorithms to compare the efficiency of an
adjacency matrix vs an adjacency list, when attempting to
create the data structures and find paths between two points.
We used data from the online fanfiction platform Archive of Our
Own (Ao3), web scraping over 100,000 fanfictions, and their taglists.
I wrote the code to turn the data points into the adjacency
matrix and adjacency list, as well as the pathfinding algorithm
for two points (we used a Breadth First Traversal to find the
shortest route between two fanfictions).
