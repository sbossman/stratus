This programming project is one I completed in high school. It parses through a TXT file of a Shakespeare play, and then
identifies all of the different characters, as well as the number
of lines they have, the words they speak, and the characters they
talk to. Using this information, I also wrote an algorithm to
distribute the different characters in the play to a different
number of "readers," so no person reading the play out loud has
to speak to themself.
