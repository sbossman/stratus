Class Capture is a project I worked on with a few others in
my class. It's a social media app that allows different users
to join groups with their friends, coworkers, or classmates,
and they can all upload photos. Then, at the end of a time
period, all of the photos they took and uploaded will be
released, so they can look back on the enjoyable times they
had together. It is currently a work in progress.

It is a full stack web app that uses ReactJS for the front end
and MongoDB for the back end. I did most of the work for the
front end for this project, so I learned a lot of React for
this project. I also did a fair amount of front end/back end
connection fetching data from the database.
