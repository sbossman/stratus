As a reader of the platform Archive of Our Own (which holds fanfiction
written about a variety of different books, movies, television shows,
etc), I wanted a way to discover the most common types of works I
read. I used a web scraping extension to scrape my reading history
into a CSV, and then parsed through that CSV in Python, in order to
discover my most beloved tropes and fandoms.
