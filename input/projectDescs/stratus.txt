Stratus is a Static Site Generator I built for this website.
It converts sites written in Stratus (a markdown language I
created for my personal convenience and comfort) into HTML,
so I can then load them onto the UF CISE web hosting (they
only allow static HTML/CSS sites). At the moment, one can
create components (such as a navigation bar) that are used
throughout different webpages on the website. One can also
create components that have parameters (as seen with the
individual projects here, which have titles, text, and links
passed in).
